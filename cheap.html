                        <h2>Hyundai Veloster</h2>

                        <p><u><b>Price: R75 895</b></u></p>

                        <p>The cheapest Hyundai Veloster is a taste of what makes driving hatchbacks fun. Even though the base engine is a 147-hp inline-four, a big leap from the sportier Veloster N's 275-horsepower turbocharged inline-four, it's still an affordable three-door compact with sharp looks and nimble handling. The Veloster is front-wheel drive only, and the cheapest model comes with a six-speed manual. The inside of the Veloster is snug and its 20 cu ft of cargo space under the hatch isn't as spacious as the Volkswagen Golf, but it's roughly the same as what's available in the more expensive Mazda 3 hatchback. Its less powerful engine gets average fuel economy, with an EPA-estimated 30 mpg combined. Even though it has a meh interior and lacks scoot juice, the base Veloster is a bargain for those who enjoy driving.</p>

                        <h2>Subaru Impreza</h2>

                        <p><u><b>Price: R49,720</b></u></p>

                        <p>Standard all-wheel-drive on the Subaru Impreza makes it the most affordable AWD vehicle available today. Power comes from a 152-hp flat-four with a five-speed manual transmission. Is it the most exciting powertrain? No, but it's a good balance of power and fuel efficiency, with an EPA-estimated 31-mpg highway fuel economy. The base Impreza does lack standard safety features. Unlike cheaper cars on this list, forward-collision warning and automated emergency braking and lane-keeping assist are all optional equipment here. The Impreza earned a Top Safety Pick+ rating from IIHS thanks to Subaru's EyeSight technology, but it's only offered on models with automatic transmissions, so not on the cheapest Impreza.</p>

                        <p><b>Base price:</b> R49,720</p>
                        <p><b>Fuel Economy EPA combined/city/highway:</b> 26/23/31 mpg</p>
                        <p><b>Warranty:</b> 5-year/60,000-mile powertrain and 3-year/36,000-mile limited warranty</p>

                        <h2>Kia Forte</h2>
                        <p><u><b>Price R57,855</b></u></p>
                        <p>The Kia Forte is among the Korean brand's top-selling models. Maybe it's because of its good looks, or its incredibly affordable price. The base engine is a 147-hp inline-four, although a turbocharged 201-hp is available for the upper GT version. A six-speed manual transmission is standard and the Forte is only offered in font-wheel drive. Inside, the 8.0-inch infotainment screen is easy to use and comes standard with modern tech like Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto. The Forte gets incredible gas mileage, with an EPA-estimated 37 mpg on they highway. It also has a larger gas tank than Honda Civic and Volkswagen Golf, meaning it has potential to travel more than 510 miles before returning to a gas station.</p>
